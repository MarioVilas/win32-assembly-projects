<a name="install"><b>Install instructions:</b></a>

To install, follow this steps:

1. Copy NewWiz.dll to your addins folder (typically C:\WinAsm\Addins).
2. Open the Addins Manager (Add-Ins -> Add-In Manager)
3. Select the addin and enable it. You can also set it to load on startup.

This is only needed for manual installs. If you installed WinAsm Studio from
 the self installing package, this add-in is already there. :)

To configure the add-in, go to the Addins Manager, select this add-in an click
 on the "Configure" button. A config dialog box will pop up, there you can
 enable or disable the GUI enhancements provided by this add-in, and set some
 other options as well.

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

<a name="usage"><b>Usage instructions:</b></a>

When the addin is installed, some dialog boxes will be replaced by new ones.
 This features can be enabled or disabled by editing the add-ins INI file: at
 the section [New Project Wizard], you can edit the keys "EnableWizard" and/or
 "EnableProperties", set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable the enhanced versions
 of the new project wizard and project properties dialogs respectively.

<a name="usage1"><b>1) The "New Project" Wizard</b></a>

The dialog box to create new projects is replaced by a wizard. In the first
 page, the user is presented with this three options:

    <i>1. Create a new empty project</i>
    <i>2. Create a new project from a template</i>
    <i>3. Create a new project from existing sources</i>

The add-in will remember the last taken choices for each page.

<a name="usage11"><b>1.1) Create a new empty project</b></a>

The wizard will prompt for a project type, and a new empty project is
 immediately created. No mistery here. ;)

<a name="usage12"><b>1.2) Create a new project from a template</b></a>

Choose a template project (projects found typically at C:\WinAsm\Templates)
 and a target folder (you can create a new one). Then the addin will copy
 all files from the template into the target directory. After that, the new
 project file will be opened. For more details on some extra features when
 creating projects from templates, please see the <a href="#templates">notes</a> below.

<a name="usage13"><b>1.3) Create a new project from existing sources</b></a>

After choosing a project type, you will be prompted for a list of files to
 be automatically included in the new project. Use this option, for example,
 if you want to convert an existing project for another IDE to WinAsm Studio.

<a name="usage14"><b>1.4) Clone an existing project</b></a>

This mode of operation is identical in all aspects to 1.3 (create a project
 from a template), except that it will let you take any WinAsm Studio project
 as if it was a template.

<a name="usage2"><b>2) The "Project Properties" dialog box</b></a>

This new version of the project properties box has two pages:

<a name="usage21"><b>2.1) The "Build" page</b></a>

From here you can configure all the command line switches that WinAsm Studio
 will use when building your project. This are the items you can configure:

    <i>Type:</i>       This is the project type. It can be one of the following:
                . Standard EXE
                . Standard DLL
                . Console Application
                . Static Library
                . Other (EXE)
                . Other (Non-EXE)
                . DOS Project
                The "Load" button lets you revert all other settings in this
                page to the defaults for the current project type. The "Save"
                button lets you change this defaults. Note that this defaults
                will also be used when creating new projects!

    <i>Compile RC:</i> This are the command line switches to pass to the resource
                compiler (RC.EXE), in case the current project has an resource
                scripts. You can click on the "Switches" button (next to the
                text box) to visually add command line switches.

    <i>Res To Obj:</i> This are the command line switches to pass to the .res to .obj
                file converter. If you don't specify any switches, this
                program won't be called during project build. You can click on
                the "Switches" button (next to the text box) to visually add
                command line switches.

    <i>Assemble:</i>   This are the command line switches to pass to the assembler
                (ML.EXE). You can click on the "Switches" button (next to the
                text box) to visually add command line switches.

    <i>Link:</i>       This are the command line switches to pass to the linker
                (LINK.EXE). You can click on the "Switches" button (next to
                the text box) to visually add command line switches.

    <i>/OUT:</i>       This lets you override the build output filename for your
                project. If you don't specify any, WinAsm will use the default
                filename (based on the project name). You can click on the
                "Browse" button (next to the text box) to browse for an output
                filename.

<a name="usage22"><b>2.2) The "Run" page</b></a>

From here you can specify any optional command line switches you may want
 WinAsm to pass to your program when you run it from the IDE. This page will
 only be visible if you run the add-in on WinAsm Studio 3.0.2.7 or above, and
 the current project builds an EXE.

You can set two different command line switches for both "release" and "debug"
 modes. Additionally, each has a set of alternative command line switches;
 these will NOT be used by WinAsm, they're just provided for your commodity.
 You can click on the "Add" button (the one with a "plus" sign) to add the
 current command line switches to the set. The "Remove" button (the one with a
 "minus" sign) will remove from the set all selected lines.

<a name="usage23"><b>2.3) The "Misc" page</b></a>

Here are all the settings that didn't belong to any of the other pages.

You can choose the compiler WinAsm will use for this project. Currently only
 MASM32 and FASM are supported (you'll need Shoorick's FASM add-in for the
 latter). Default is MASM32.

There are two more options: "Auto increment file version" and "Handle RC files
 incompatible statements silently", of obvious meanings.

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

<a name="templates"><b>Notes on project templates:</b></a>

Project templates are found typically at C:\WinAsm\Templates. They are ordinary
 projects, whose .wap file MUST be named after the directory they reside. They
 are used to quickly create new projects without having to start from scratch.
 For more information on WinAsm Studio project templates, please see the help
 file (Help -> WinAsm Studio Help).

This add-in provides some features to enhance the functionality of WinAsm
 Studio project templates:

<a name="templates1"><b>1) Environment variables substitutions</b></a>

If you use any environment variables in the template's WAP file, they will be
 expanded when creating the new project. There are also some "special"
 environment variables provided by the add-in: (folders don't have an ending
 backslash in this case)

    <i>%project%</i>         Project filename
    <i>%folder%</i>          Project folder
    <i>%title%</i>           Project title
    <i>%wafolder%</i>        WinAsm folder (usually C:\WinAsm)
    <i>%waaddins%</i>        Add-Ins folder (usually C:\WinAsm\AddIns)
    <i>%wabin%</i>           Bin folder (usually C:\masm32\bin)
    <i>%wainc%</i>           Include folder (usually C:\masm32\include)
    <i>%walib%</i>           Library folder (usually C:\masm32\lib)

You can use this variables in the make command line switches (under the [MAKE]
 section in the .wap file), the project filenames (under the [FILES] section),
 and/or the run command line switches (under the [PROJECT] section).

<a name="templates2"><b>2) The [TEMPLATE] section</b></a>

Project templates can have an extra section named [TEMPLATE], which will be
 automatically removed from the resulting .wap file when creating a new
 project. This section contains some extra info the add-in can use.

This section currently has two keys: "Parse" and "Rename".

The "Parse" key consists of a list of filenames, separated by commas, in which
 the add-in will search for environment variable names and replace them for
 their contents.

The "Rename" key is a boolean (0 for false, 1 for true) that enables another
 feature: when this key is set to true, any files in the newly created project
 that have the same name as the template will be renamed after the new project
 title. For example, if you have a template called "Test", and you create a
 project named "New", all files named "Test.*" will be renamed to "New.*". Note
 that the add-in will NOT recurse subdirectories.

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

<a name="developers"><b>Notes for add-in developers:</b></a>

Some private messages are sent to all addins in their FrameWindow procedure, to
 notify of certain events. The numeric IDs of this messages can be obtained
 like this:

    invoke RegisterWindowMessage,CTEXT("MessageStringID")

where "MessageStringID" is a placeholder for the actual string ID.

This are the supported string IDs and their corresponding events:

    <i>WANewWizAddInBegin</i>  (+1.1.0.7) The "New Project Wizard" addin has been
                         loaded. You can edit WAAddIns.ini before the settings
                         are read.
    <i>WANewWizAddInEnd</i>    (+1.1.0.7) The "New Project Wizard" addin has been
                         unloaded. You can edit WAAddIns.ini after the settings
                         are saved.
    <i>WAProjPropMsg</i>       (+1.1.0.0) The new project properties dialog box was
                         opened. Since it's a standard property sheet you can
                         add new pages to it. The wParam value is the window
                         handle. The expected page size is 227 x 220 DBUs.
